# tmux-voice

tmux-voice is a Flutter + Riverpod client aimed at driving tmux over SSH with a voice-first workflow.

## Getting Started

1. Create a `.env` file with GROQ/Gemini API keys for the upcoming STT + LLM features.
2. Run `flutter pub get`.
3. Launch with `flutter run` (mobile/desktop/web) after providing valid SSH profiles inside the app UI.

The project is still under heavy development; see the issue tracker/backlog for open work.
